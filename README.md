#This is my first project. I have figured that sometimes people use many emoticons but we couldn't understand many of those. So that's why I made a project that can convert emoticons to emoji.I am trying to improve this program.<br>

Description <br>
When you run the code it will ask for a input.You just have to write something like Hello :) or goodbye :( or see you :( .Anything you write it can output a emoji.I know it's not neccesary at all.But i wrote this code for fun.My first very own code with python.I will try to add some new feature to it in futture.<br>

Instruction <br>
First,Write a word or small sentence with a emoticon.Just make sure you wirte the emoticon last.Example: Hello :) <br>
Just like that.It stuck when you write two emoticon together.I am trying to fix that problem.<br>
